## Why it was born?
First, I never like the idea of re-inventing the wheel. I need an image annotation tool for a very simple task: drawing bounding boxes in different angles around interested objects. I went through many available tools (free and paid tools) in the internet but none of them can let me do such simple task. So here we go: I need a very simple and fast tool for quickly annotating my image dataset.

## Required packages
* PyQt5
